# mockk-mockkobject-companion-error
A small repository to showcase what seems to be a bug in the mockk library, in order to create an issue and discuss with the Mockk team.

Just run the test in `ClassWithCompanionTest` to see it in action.

The issue in the mockk repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mockk/mockk/issues/1128)
